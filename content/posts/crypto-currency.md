Everyone's talking about crypto coins like bitcoin. What exactly is it? Is it a good investment?

Crypto currencies are like money that can be used to pay for things, but it is generally used as an investment. There is no central authority like a bank, instead it use a broadly distributed ledger across the internet to capture transactions. "Miners" validate a block of payments for validity - for which they receive a small amount of crypto currency.

Mining uses intensive compute power - and hence electricity. 60-80% of cost of mining goes to cover electricity. Look for Proof of Stake, rather than Proof of Work, as a faster and cheaper way to validate blocks.

Bitcoin is referred to as the "digital gold" standard.

eGifter provides a way to turn bitcoins in to gift cards. Robinhood also offers a low cost way to trade against them.
