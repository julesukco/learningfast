**Summary:**   
Leaders inspire with expertise, vision, and judgment. You should consider who is on your broader team, and who you can recruit to help you achieve the goal. Real leadership is about getting others excited about new possibilities. Bring a sense of possibility to others.  
What's someone's blue flame (their passion/meaning). Find it and help them nurture it.  
Practice radical inclusion - get others involved, generate more ideas, and execute faster. Psychological safety is at its highest with 3 people. Collaborative problem-solving - ask a question, break people into groups of three to come up with solutions, and then have one person do a readout.  
Ask how and what, not why. Why puts people on the defensive. Acknowledge people for their efforts, showing up, and applying themselves. When you celebrate what people are doing well they are more energized and engaged in fixing what they are doing wrong. Find one area that someone is winning in and laud that to everyone. Be a huge promoter of people, always oversell them - they will rise to it. Grow your brand as a celebrator.  
People are slow to believe but quick to adapt.

**Rules:**

1. Who is your team?
2. Accept that it's all up to you
