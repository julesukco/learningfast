People want to be understood and accepted - listening is the best tool. Try mirroring - repeating the last three words the other person spoke.

Slow. It. Down.

Labeling - recognize an emotion and verbalize it back. "It seems like you ...", "It sounds like ...", ". If they disagree, say "I didn't say it was that, just that it seems that way." Allow a silence after the label - let the other person reveal themselves.

Labeling negatives diffuses them, labeling positives enhances them.

Top guys like to feel on top. 

Accusation audit - call out downsides first.

A trap is to take what people say literally. Don't imagine the other person is like you, or thinks like you.

Start the negotiation with a "No" to make the other side feel in control, then ask "what about this doesn't work for you?". 

No deal is better than a bad deal. Beware a deadline. Make your deadline known early.
