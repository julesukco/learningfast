Summary:

People want to be understood and accepted - listening is the best tool. Try mirroring - repeating the last three words the other person spoke.

Slow. It. Down.

Labeling - recognize an emotion and verbalize it back. "It seems like you ...", "It sounds like ...", ". If they disagree, say "I didn't say it was that, just that it seems that way." Allow a silence after the label - let the other person reveal themselves. Labeling negatives diffuses them, labeling positives enhances them.

Accusation audit - call out downsides first.

A trap is to take what people say literally. Don't imagine the other person is like you, or thinks like you.

Start the negotiation with a "No" to make the other side feel in control, then ask "what about this doesn't work for you?". Top guys like to feel on top.

No deal is better than a bad deal. Beware a deadline. Make your deadline known early.

"anchor and adjustment" is the tendency to be anchored by extreme numbers. Experienced negotiators lead with an extreme offer.

"prospect theory" - people are drawn to sure things over probabilities.

"loss aversion" - people take greater risk to avoid loss than make a gain. Potential losses factor more for people than potential gains.

Offer up a range, with the low end being what you want for it. Don't use round numbers. Exact numbers feel more permanent. Offer an exact amount and a gift - makes the other side think there is no more money coming.

A change in negotiators always means they are going to take a harder line.

Put it back on them by saying "how am I supposed to do that?" and then wait for them to help solve the problem. Start questions back with "how..." and "what..." so they are open ended. Since the other side is coming up with the answers they will be more invested in seeing it through. Since they are coming up with the answer they again think they have control.

Say no four times:

1. "How am I supposed to do that?"
2. "Your offer is very generous. I'm sorry that just does not work for me."
3. "I'm sorry but I'm afraid I just can't do that."
4. "I'm sorry, no." - make sure to use a downward inflection in the "no"

Ackerman method - offer 65%, then 85%, then 95%, then 100%. Smaller increments, use exact numbers.

Black Swan theory - tells us things happen that we never thought possible, or thought of.
