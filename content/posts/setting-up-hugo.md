Getting up and running was the typical technology experience. Simple instructions, easy to follow instructions. Unexpected errors and long periods of time debugging.

1. Start with the end in mind. The first thing I did was to purchase the domain name using Google domains.
2. Setting up Hugo was pretty easy from the command line. Did run into an issue with a custom theme that caused no pages to be rendered - moral of the story: **just use the default options first, and then modify later**.
3. Forestry.io was probably the easiest part. Did receive a weird error message. A quick google search of the entire error message revealed an issue. A simple config update and I now have a full-function CMS running to manage my site.
4. Netlify was an easy start (but does not work well with Safari).  Getting DNS setup was a bit confusing but got through it pretty quickly. Too bad there's so a long delay for DNS propagation to start working.

   Update: DNS propagation much faster than advertised - up and running in under an hour! The site is live.
