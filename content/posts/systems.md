My Systems

I like to be organized for the benefit of reducing stress and increasing the feeling of control. Lightweight systems over the years work best for me and provide the best staying power. Below are my current systems on thoughts on them:

**Things I Am Trying**

* **20 Minutes Per Day** - Reading and studying architecture books. Mark Richards introduced me to the concept.
* **No Infinite Scrolling** - Take a break for a month from Twitter, except for researching. Spend more time focused on things that I want to do. The idea came from [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/me) on here online blog.
* **Writing** - LearningFast.io is my online attempt to process what I am learning by putting in down on paper. Doesn't really matter if anyone ever reads this if it helps me understand what I am doing.

**Established Systems**

* **Weekly review** - Properly the most beneficial system (thank you David Allen for introducing this in your GTD book). It's the one thing that has stuck over many years and provides an incredible sense of control over my life and the upcoming week. It's an excellent way to brain dump everything on your mind and feel empowered to do something about them.
* **Journal** - Goals, tasks and reflections are written in my bullet journal. There's something about writing that slows you down, helps focus on the few things that are really important, rather than endlessly capturing tasks into a todo app (I've tried them all over the years - my revelation was that starting a new app was so appealing because it was actually a chance to ditch all my accumulated tasks and start fresh). Paper forces that since it's impossible to re-write hundreds of tasks every week.
