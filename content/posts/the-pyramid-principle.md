So What, Who Cares?

* Always start with answer this question
* Start with:
  * Situation - something everyone knows
  * Challenge - the problem
  * Solution - the answer/recommendation

Barbara Minto wrote the book The Pyramid Principle which has become a staple for the big consulting companies to train their consultants how to communicate more effectively. It can help you too.

Write the document and then come back then delete all adjectives (better, smaller, faster, slower, bigger, etc.) and replace with real numbers. It makes the document more precise and less subjective.

Alan Crawford built on this and added some tips:

1. Say what you want: be direct
2. Write the way you talk: short sentences, simple language
3. Enumerate points as lists
