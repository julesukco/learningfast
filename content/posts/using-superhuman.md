# Does Superhuman give the perfect email experience?

Superhuman is a new email client. It is supposedly a massive leap forward in how you work with your email. Will Superhuman revolutionize how I work with email? It's certainly a luxury item, at $30 per month, when most email clients are free. So is it that good? What does it teach us about using email? Can I replicate it for less money?

1. Customer service is amazing. Live, in-person onboarding. Personalized video from support team lead. Super easy to submit questions and feedback to the team. Replicate: No.
2. Keystrokes enable all functionality on the desktop - makes it seem very quick to move through emails. Replicate: Keyboard Maestro could help - but not to the same experience as it is so ingrained into the product.
3. Everything feels very focused - when you are reading an email all you can see is that one email. Replicate: Could probably change my setup in outlook to get close.
4. Marking an email as done you move straight to the next email. This really helps you get in the zone in moving quickly through a lot of emails. Replicate: Could probably change my setup in outlook to get close.
5. Defer to the desktop is one of the best snooze features. Replicate: Didn't see an obvious way to do this in Apple mail
6. Inbox zero gets rewarded by a beautiful background image. Sometimes a landscape. Sometimes an animal. Consistently the application impressed with a premium experience, that made me keep coming back for more.

So, a couple of days in and my sentiment so far is that the prime benefits are pretty unique. This does not feel like an experience easily replicated.

Day 3 sentiment: I find myself wanting to get more emails so that I can process them in Superhuman. Hard to believe I am saying that. It is a very slick, premium feeling app to use that I've not experienced before and would be hard to replicate.

It's now been a couple of weeks using Superhuman, and it's still engrossing. I hit the elusive inbox 0, across many email accounts, at least 3 times every week!

* Deferring emails feels like a trap. It encourages me to hide things I don't want to decide on - I'll need to watch that one.
* Speed and keyboard shortcuts are vital to the experience
* The gradual exposure of the product through daily emails, and consciously not overwhelming the user too soon is a very effective concept.
