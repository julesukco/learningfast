For those who have not heard/used the Superman human email client, it is supposed to be a massive leap forward in how you work with your email. It's certainly a luxury item, at $30 per month when most email clients are free. So is it that good? What does it teach us about using email? Can it be replicated for less?

1. Customer service is amazing. Live, in-person onboarding. Personalized video from support team lead. Super easy to submit questions and feedback to the team. Replicate: No.
2. Everything is done via a keystroke on the desktop - makes it seem very quick to move through emails. Replicate: Keyboard Maestro could help - but not to the same experience as it is so ingrained into the product.
3. Everything feels very focused - when you are reading an email all you can see is that one email. Replicate: Could probably change my setup in outlook to get close.
4. Once an item is marked as done you move straight to the next email. This really helps you get in the zone in moving quickly through a lot of emails. Replicate: Could probably change my setup in outlook to get close.
5. Defer to the desktop is one of the best snooze features. Replicate: Didn't see an obvious way to do this in Apple mail
6. Hitting inbox zero is rewarded by a beautiful background image. Sometimes a landscape. Sometimes an animal. Consistently the application impressed with a premium experience, that is something to be looked forward to.

So, a couple of days in and the sentiment so far is that the prime benefits are pretty unique and could not replicate the experience.

Day 3 sentiment: I actually find myself wanting to get more emails (who would ever think of saying that) so that I can process them in Superhuman. It is a very slick, premium feeling app to use that I've not experienced before and would be hard to replicate.

It's now been a couple of weeks using Superhuman, and I am still engrossed by it. I hit the elusive inbox 0, across many email accounts, at least 3 times every week!

* Deferring is a bad habit the tool allows and encourages me to hide things I don't want to decide on - need to watch that one
* Speed and keyboard shortcuts are vital to the experience
* The gradual exposure of the product through daily emails, and consciously not overwhelming the user to soon is a very effective concept.
